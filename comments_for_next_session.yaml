General comments: |
    
    I have renamed variables so they read clearly from an outside perspective and to avoid getting confused. I have created a yaml file outlining the new variable names and purposes to reduce the number of comments in file. I have done the same for new functions. I have employed functional programming techniques throughout the code with varying success!

Simulation of strand length: |
    
    I have fixed the issue with sci py special.factorial. We need to use 'from scipy.special import factorial'
    What is importance of date time?
    Confused when it comes to the third histogram, why does this rely on length_strand instead of length_segment?
    In main for loop what is num_hist_here, len_hist_here section? What does 'end' mean and do? 
    Is there a better way we could write n_poiss_plot and k_poiss_plot? I do not understand what these variables mean.


DNA Clumping: |

    Attempted to employ functional programming techniques but struggling with passing/returning parameters and the logic. I would like to find a way to keep all info for same graph together for clearer reading.
    'cols' and 'col' are confusing, would like to suggest writing as 'columns' and 'color'.
    What is 'use_sphere'? I understanding setting Boolean variables but unsure as to why and how this is used in the code.
    What does 'sig_radius_cell' mean? Unsure as to meaning of sig specifically.
    Why are we using a minimum radius of cell/nucleus?
    


Motion of DNA in Agrose: |

    Date and time calculations have been repeated, is there a way we can write a function of date time that can be used across the whole notebook to avoid repeating code? I have tried working on this myself but I am having problems understanding the logic of system so I have moved these variables into a seperate cell and focused on the rest of this section.
    What is importance of date time in this section?
    In velocity_in_agarose():, what is kB, kC, kL, alpha?
    Could velocity field graph and velocity length graph be written in functions to keep the code clear as to which line has which impact?
