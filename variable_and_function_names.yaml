Variables: |

    no_single_strands: Number of single DNA strands
    
    length_strand: Length of DNA strand, this is a measurement of base pairs.
    
    mean_breaks: Average number of breaks per strand.
    
    no_breaks: number of breaks
    
    no_segments: Number of segments generated after proton therapy has been applied and strands have been broken.
    
    length_segment: Length of segments
    
    k: Number of occurrances for poisson function
    
    lam: Poisson function lambda


Functions: |

    date_time(): Returns date and time programme is run at
    
    poisson_function(k, lam): Determines a poisson distribution from k number of occurrances and lam lambda, this is called in data_visualisation()
    
    data_visualisation(mean_breaks, length_strand, length_segment): Data visualisation of number of breaks of dna strands and segment lengths
