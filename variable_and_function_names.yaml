Simulation of strand length: |
    
    
    VARIABLES
    no_single_strands: Number of single DNA strands
    length_strand: Length of DNA strand, this is a measurement of base pairs.
    mean_breaks: Average number of breaks per strand.
    no_breaks: number of breaks
    no_segments: Number of segments generated after proton therapy has been applied and strands have been broken.
    length_segment: Length of segments
    k: Number of occurrances for poisson function
    lam: Poisson function lambda
    
    FUNCTIONS
    date_time(): Returns date and time programme is run at
    poisson_function(k, lam): Determines a poisson distribution from k number of occurrances and lam lambda, this is called in data_visualisation()
    data_visualisation(mean_breaks, length_strand, length_segment): Data visualisation of number of breaks of dna strands and segment lengths

Motion of DNA in Agrose: |


    VARIABLES
    velocity: calculated in velocity_in_agarose()
    
    FUNCTIONS
    velocity_in_agarose(): Given length of DNA strand (in kbp) and electric field (in V/cm) returns velocity in agarose (in cm/s * 10^4 or equivalently microns/s).
    called in two plotting for loops.
